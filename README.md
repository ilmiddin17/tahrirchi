# Tahrirchi task


In parser.py file I parsed information from kun.uz In the website there are several catogories. I choose "Jamiyat" category. If you want to change category you should change the `url` in the parser.py. And there is a variable `n`. If it is needed more data you should increase its value


data.csv consist of 3 columns access_url, access_datetime and content
